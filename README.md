# OOP Design Patterns in C#
This repo contains examples projects for design patterns. Some projects will also have diagrams which I will put in this readme.

### note
The scenarios are very simple, The should NOT be used to decide when to use a certain design pattern.

## Factory Method
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects.
I used calculating tax as example scenario to implement Factory method.
